Mental Health Quantifier

The definition of mental disorders describes them as health conditions involving changes in emotion, thinking or behavior or a combination
of these". Contemporary societies of 2020 still fall short in recognizing some
of the most common afflictions as actual problems in people. Some of those
are depression, anxiety and stress disorders.
This project includes a Machine Learning based approach wherein the anal-
ysis of the multiple choice inputs along with a neatly curated questionnaire
based on feature extraction will be done and then supervised classication al-
gorithms(LR, KNN, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, DT, RF) will be used to generate a mental health score as well as a detailed
report based on responses the user gives.
